Challenges:
While decoding data of a HTTP response of a API there were many discrepancies such as missing values etc.
So I tried to use null checking etc but the issue was not resolving. In this yummly API there were food images which i wanted to use as 
cover for the recipe cards.

I tried two more API and various problem arose.
I finally found an API with decent data . (Recipe by API-Ninjas).
I then Used the API to make a list of Recipe titles and number of servings.
I then provided with ingredient list and instructions for the recipe.

apk file is available for use as app.apk
